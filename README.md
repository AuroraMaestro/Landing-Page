# Landing Page Project

This is the sumbission for the first Web Development Professional Nanodegree Program (The Landing Project). 

## Content of the project

The project consists of a simple web page layout containing a navigation bar and sections filling most of the body's web page. 

Within the navigation bar we have clickable links - with the section's name - that smoothly redirects the user to the desired  section.

Upon viewing the section, its corresponding clickable link in the navigation bar is highlighted indicating which section is currently viewed. Moreover, the section's background change according to which section is present on the user's screen (viewport).
